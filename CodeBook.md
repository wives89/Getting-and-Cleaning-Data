Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean

tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


Data Desctription
==================================================================
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Clean Version 1.0

The data was collected with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
------------------------------------------
- Mean and std of the Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Mean and std of the Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
------------------------------------------

- 'CodeBook.md': shows information on the variables used in the data, description of how the data and description of data transformations

- 'activitydata.txt': Shows data as described above

- 'datasummary.txt': Summarizes data by mean by activity by person


Data Transformations:
==========================================
To transform this data into tidy data the following steps were performed.

1. Combined the x test, y test, x train and y train data sets from the original data sets into a larger set with all 30 test subjects.
2. Renamed the columns to more logical names.
3. Removed all of the columns not related to the mean or standard deviation measurements.
4. Re-ordered the columns so that Subject Number and Activity are first 2 columns
5. For datasummary.txt file grouped by Activity and Subject Number and then summarized by the mean.
